2. **APPLICATION TOKEN**: This is the token associated with the Entity you created for your application.

3. **ENDPOINT**: Specify the endpoint based on your use case. It can be `US`, `EU`, or `staging`.

### Initializing the CAF Tracker

```javascript
nrvideo.Core.addTracker(new nrvideo.CAFTracker(receiverContext, authCredentials = { 
    accountId: "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
    applicationToken: "<APPLICATION_TOKEN>",
    endpoint: "<ENDPOINT>"
}));
